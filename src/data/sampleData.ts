    notes: "The Blue and White #5 Shad Rap had been sitting in my box for who knows how long, waiting for a river worth its attention. Found one that October day in '94.\n\nWe put in at Spring River Oaks - Westfall, Teal, Mr. Scott, and Manis - aimed for Hardy Beach in the Sea King Semi V. The distance had opinions we hadn't consulted. Came up short by enough miles that an elderly couple had to shuttle us down to retrieve the takeout vehicle. The river had already started teaching me about optimism.\n\nSpent the night at Bayou Access, put in at Many Islands the next morning. Cool, overcast, the kind of weather that makes fish conversational. The Blue and White did most of the talking. Caught my first Spring River walleye. First Shadow Bass. First Spotted Bass. First smallmouth that mattered.\n\nThe #5 Shad Rap has been in the rotation ever since. Some relationships start right.",

The sky had other plans. A storm rolled in with the kind of wind and lightning that makes you wonder about your life choices, standing in an aluminum boat holding a graphite rod.\n\nI caught a three-pound brownie on the Blue/White Shad Rap. Yvonne caught her first Spring River walleye right in the teeth of it, followed that up with a good-sized Shadow Bass. The fish didn't seem to mind the drama. Centipedes on Texas rigs, Shad Rap number fives. Sometimes the weather decides when you catch them.",

    notes: "Ed Mullins Ramp to Harold B. Ed Mullins was an elder fisherman we'd meet years later, though we didn't know it yet. The river works like that sometimes. Went upstream three-quarters of a hole, then turned around and let the current do the rest. I caught 24 fish - spots, blacks, brownies - on spoons, jig and pig, centipedes. Tim's fishing scent made the difference on the drop baits. I won't admit how long I argued that scent didn't matter.\n\nHooked a big brownie on the BCW #5. Pulled hard enough to make me believe in it. Got off due to my failings and a rod that thought it knew better than the fish. The stiff ones always cost you.",

    notes: "Ravenden down to Imboden, 5.3 miles. Fall color in full display. Sunny and warm in the 70s, the kind of day that makes you forget it's November.\n\nThe bite was decent but strange. Fish followed lures up to the boat but wouldn't commit. Scent didn't help. Mr. Scott caught a 19.5-inch smallie on an iridescent Shad Rap, then caught more on it, then lost the lure and the bite waned. He also caught a nice sauger.\n\nI caught 5 blacks. One went 6.5 pounds, 22.5 inches long. Caught it on a jig and peed in Gord green orange, back in the still water off the main current. Also used the perch Shad Rap with some success.\n\nA guide boat started pushing us downstream faster than we wanted to move. The water was stained with good current. I found an ultra-small soft-shelled turtle and traded it to Mr. Scott for a shad-colored Flicker Shad with a red tail.",

    notes: "We'd planned to fish Ravenden to Imboden again, but the guide was back at the ramp. We changed plans accordingly and pointed north to the Eleven Point. Dalton down to the Highway 90 bridge, approximately 8 miles of water as beautiful as any we've fished.\n\nThe weather was fantastic - sunny, warm, clear, breezy. I caught 2 walleye and a sauger trolling a perch-colored Shad Rap #5. Caught 5 blacks, 7 brownies, 3 spotted bass. The jig and peed worked when I remembered to use it.\n\nMr. Scott caught 2 walleye, 1 black, 9 brownies, 3 spots. The walleyes came trolling in the holes shaded by high ridges and bluffs. Good stream flow. Falling leaves crowded the water column, making it hard to fish a crankbait.\n\nWe saw 2 osprey, Cooper's hawks, redtails, Sharp-Shinned hawks, kingfishers, blue herons. The traffic on Highway 62 and 412 was horrible with road rage drivers everywhere. The river's been here longer than the highways, and it thinks the whole thing's funny.\n\nFor the two-day trip we kept 17 bass, 4 walleye, 2 saugers, 1 channel catfish. The two saugers were loaded with un-ripe egg sacks. Two bass had small crawfish inside - green and orange. The jig and peed had been right all along.\n\nThirty years of this water, more or less. The Blue Shad Rap's still in the box. The river's still here. That seems like enough.",
