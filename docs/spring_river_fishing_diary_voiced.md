## 10/7/1994 – First Time on the Spring River

The Blue and White #5 Shad Rap had been sitting in my box for who knows how long, waiting for a river worth its attention. Found one that October day in '94.

We put in at Spring River Oaks - Westfall, Teal, Mr. Scott, and Manis - aimed for Hardy Beach in the Sea King Semi V. The distance had opinions we hadn't consulted. Came up short by enough miles that an elderly couple had to shuttle us down to retrieve the takeout vehicle. The river had already started teaching me about optimism.

Spent the night at Bayou Access, put in at Many Islands the next morning. Cool, overcast, the kind of weather that makes fish conversational. The Blue and White did most of the talking. Caught my first Spring River walleye. First Shadow Bass. First Spotted Bass. First smallmouth that mattered.

The #5 Shad Rap has been in the rotation ever since. Some relationships start right.

---

## 10/09/1998 – Boodrow's First Spring River Float

Took Boodrow up river from Spring River Valley Campground to introduce him to the Spring. The river looked at us and went back to sleep.

Boodrow caught two, maybe three brownies. I caught a gar. Can't recall how far we went. Memory tends to protect you from days like that.

---

## 10/11/1998 – Many Islands Float

Put in at Many Islands with Boodrow, floated down to SRV. The river had changed its mind since two days prior.

We caught 2 Shadow Bass, 40 smallmouth, 2 spotted bass, 2 blacks, and a walleye. Sunny, cool, water stained the right kind of brown. The Blue Shad Rap took the walleye. Jig and pig, tubes, centipedes handled the rest.

Forty smallmouth on a fall day. The numbers don't need commentary.

---

## 2/15/2002 – Upstream from Hardy

Left Hot Springs at 0330, arrived Hardy at 0730. Captain Teal and I worked upstream from the low water bridge - shoals, holes, runs, all the way to the Trophy Hole. We named it that years back. The trophies have been inconsistent, but the name held.

Caught 8 fish, all above 16 inches. Four brownies, three blacks, one pushing 4.5 pounds. Seven of mine came on a FLW brown/orange jig with green pumpkin trailer, tight to cover. One on a Blue Shad Rap #7.

The fish bit especially hard when the train went down the track. Railroad rhythms and bass behavior - the river keeps its reasons to itself.

Opened up the stomach contents. Green, orange, brown. Same colors as my bait. The jig and peed had been right all along.

No luck trolling. No walleye. You can't have everything, even when the brownies are oversized.

---

## 2/16/2002 – Upstream from Hardy, Day 2

Teal and I fished two holes most of the day, up and down, working them like we had something to prove.

Teal caught a 3.5 pound brownie on a crawler rig in the rock bass eddy below the lagoon, near Turnover Shoal. I caught three good brownies, a black, and a rocker. Eight fish total. Largest February creel to date.

Tim Scott caught a 6-pound black on a Blue Shad Rap. Great trip, despite zero walleye and no trolling success. Sometimes the brownies carry the day.

---

## 2/19/2005 – Crawdad Trip, Day 1

SRV upriver to the Trophy Hole with Mr. Scott. He caught a 6-pound-plus, 27-inch walleye on a jig and leech right below Turnover Shoals. One of the largest walleyes to date. February 2005. The fish have been trying to beat it ever since.

I caught 11 fish - 10 brownies and a Shadow Bass on jig and pig, BCW, and a spoon. River was optimal. Cloudy, threat of rain all day, windy and cool. Crankbait conditions.

We saw a Great Blue Heron rookery, turkeys on the roost, a mink on the low water bridge. The river puts on a show when the fishing's already good.

---

## 2/20/2005 – Crawdad Trip, Day 2

Put in at HB Alexander, worked upriver and down. River was high and moving, skies clearing and warming. Fast current. We found a backwater out of the main flow - blacks and spots holding there, but we only managed four fish from it.

I caught 9 fish: 2 spots, 7 brownies. The BCW produced a walleye. Tim caught a trout, white crappie, rock bass, brownie, and a black.

Encountered 50 or so turkeys at the ramp. Scott found a Florida Gators hat in the mud. He's worn it for 20 years now. Some things choose you.

---

## 2/21/2005 – Crawdad Trip, Day 3

Spring River Valley low water bridge upriver to Turnover Shoal. Water was stained after a thunderstorm rolled through.

Mr. Scott did well with the green orange chartreuse broken tail Shad Rap #5. Caught a good brownie trolling with the same lure. I caught one fish. Scott caught four smallies.

Three days on the river. Some days you carry the catch, some days it's the other way around.

---

## 11/10/2007 – Arkansas Sheriff's Ranch

Departed Hot Springs with Yvonne, stopped to look at granite countertops for the new home. Tennessee embarrassed the Hogs. We traveled up to Riverside looking for my walleye photograph. No luck on that front either.

Some days the river is optional.

---

## 11/11/2007 – SRV Upriver in the Scanoe

Yvonne and I took the scanoe from SRV upriver, made it to the Walleye/Brownie Trophy Hole by late afternoon. River was beautiful with fall color, running very low at 3.17 feet.

We caught several fish on the T-rigged centipede in Cotton Candy. Yvonne fished well - four smallies, one near 3 pounds. I caught nine fish. We caught a very large rainbow trout somewhere in there.

Saw turtles, hawks, eagles, kingfishers, herons, bivalves. Fished until dark. Ate dinner at the bed and breakfast inn.

The river was low enough you could see what it usually keeps to itself.

---

## 11/12/2007 – AR Sheriff's Ranch, Fern Taylor's

Departed at seven in the morning, took the scenic route through Cherokee Village on 175 north to 298, looking at houses like we had money. Made it to Bayou Access first, put in, fished a couple of shoals. The river looked at us. We loaded back up.

Fern Taylor's Fish Camp seemed like better odds. Scanoed upstream to the Trophy Hole. The sky had other plans. A storm rolled in with the kind of wind and lightning that makes you wonder about your life choices, standing in an aluminum boat holding a graphite rod.

I caught a three-pound brownie on the Blue/White Shad Rap. Yvonne caught her first Spring River walleye right in the teeth of it, followed that up with a good-sized Shadow Bass. The fish didn't seem to mind the drama. Centipedes on Texas rigs, Shad Rap number fives. Sometimes the weather decides when you catch them.

---

## 9/20/2010 – Hardy low water bridge

Left Hot Springs at three-thirty in the morning, which is either dedication or poor judgment. Arrived at Hardy low water bridge by eight. James and I took the Coleman Crawdad, Tim went solo in his Scamper. Made it up to Trophy Hole. Beautiful hot day, the kind that reminds you why you do this.

For the day, I caught ten rockers, twenty-six brownies, and one walleye. The numbers speak for themselves.

---

## 9/21/2010 – Riverside to Fern Taylor's

Put in at Riverside at one in the afternoon, made it to Fern Taylor's by one-thirty in the morning. Twelve hours on the water. Five rockers, seven brownies, nine rainbow trout, and two walleyes. Beautiful day, one of those floats that earns a second line in the ledger.

---

## 6/24/2011 – SRV up river (42 Shadow Bass day)

Spring River Valley Campground upstream to the original Walleye Shoal. River running at 3.6 feet. Severe storms decided to make an appearance. We caught forty-two Rock and Shadow Bass. WC pulled a pair of four-pound blacks, I caught two walleyes on the yellow perch Shad Rap. Three rainbow trout rounded it out.

Best luck came on Texas-rigged centipedes in Cotton Candy with red slip sinkers, gray-red jig with cotton candy centipede. Most of the Shadow Bass came doodling logs in the secret hole above the SRV put-in. The hole sits upriver of the shoal, up and to the left. You wouldn't know it was there unless someone showed you, or you spent enough time looking.

Ate barbecue dinner at the Hardy Beach Club. Forty-two Shadow Bass doesn't need commentary.

---

## 6/25/2011 – Fern Taylor Camp

Put in at Fern Taylor Camp, worked well above the Walleye Shoal. Caught twenty-five fish including a walleye and a good number of rock bass. Same lures as the day before, same results. The river was consistent if nothing else.

Ate dinner at the St. Line Cafe, toured Mammoth Spring State Park afterward. Sometimes you fish, sometimes you see the country.

---

## 6/26/2011 – Fern Taylor Camp downriver

Six in the morning to ten-thirty, Fern Taylor Camp downstream to Disaster Falls. Hit the backwater camp hole. Caught eighteen fish, one walleye in the mix. Saw soft-shelled turtles and bald eagles. The eagles have been working that stretch longer than I have.

Ate lunch at the Corner Booth.

---

## June 2011 Trip Summary

For the trip: eighty-eight fish. One green sunfish, three trout, forty-two rock bass, two walleyes, thirty-six brownies, four black bass. The numbers tell most of the story. The rest is in how the light sat on the water and whether your shoulder hurts the next day.

---

## 10/10/2011 – Fern Taylor's Fish Camp

Left the house at three-thirty, arrived at Fern Taylor's by seven-thirty. Floated upstream. Forty smallies, three walleye, twenty-nine Shadow Bass, and one large carp that probably didn't appreciate the attention.

The walleyes came on Shad Raps and jigging spoons. Cotton candy centipede and jig and peed accounted for the Shadow Bass. Warm day, water levels on the low side. Most of our fish came from the lagoon downstream from Taylor Camp. Clint and I had worked that same spot in summer catching forty-two Shadow Bass over two or three days. The fish remember, or they don't. Either way, they were home.

---

## 10/11/2011 – Hardy Beach to Harold B

Hardy Beach to Harold B. Thomason, Williams, Lockwood, and Mr. Scott came along. Sig and I caught forty smallies, five walleyes, one drum, one carp, a crappie, and a catfish. The fish were bunched below the shoals like they'd gotten the memo. Spoons accounted for most of the catches.

Weather was windy and cool. For my personal tally: seven walleyes (six on the spoon), twenty Shadow Bass, one crappie, five drum, two carp, one spot, three black bass, a catfish, and twenty smallies. Nice time had by all, which is what you write when the fish cooperate and nobody breaks anything.

---

## Walleye Tips

Work lures slow. Search current breaks, creek mouths, rock outcrops, dams, shoals, fallen timber, river bends, islands, culverts. The usual suspects. When current runs high, look for shallow water breaks. Most people on the Spring River fish near the rock falls because that's where everyone fishes. Look for the other places. The head of the rapids. They call it fishing the push.

Look for holding spots below the shoals. The fish are there or they're not, but you won't know until you check. The river's been holding walleyes longer than anyone's been catching them. It knows what it's doing. Your job is to pay attention.

---

## 10/8/2012 – Intruder 12 Trip day 1

Left Hot Springs at 3:30 in the morning because that's when you leave if you want to be on the water when the light's right. Made Hardy by 7:30, moved upstream from SRV to Fern Taylor's Fish Camp. Caught 13 fish between the two of us. Nine of mine came on spoons - not because I'm clever, just because I kept throwing them. Saw bald eagles and hawks working the same water we were. They had better luck.

---

## 10/9/2012 – Intruder 12 Trip day 2

Ed Mullins Ramp to Harold B. Ed Mullins was an elder fisherman we'd meet years later, though we didn't know it yet. The river works like that sometimes. Went upstream three-quarters of a hole, then turned around and let the current do the rest. I caught 24 fish - spots, blacks, brownies - on spoons, jig and pig, centipedes. Tim's fishing scent made the difference on the drop baits. I won't admit how long I argued that scent didn't matter.

Hooked a big brownie on the BCW #5. Pulled hard enough to make me believe in it. Got off due to my failings and a rod that thought it knew better than the fish. The stiff ones always cost you.

---

## 10/10/2012 – Intruder 12 Trip day 3

Same stretch as yesterday. Caught 9 brownies. Tim's truck went down in Batesville, which is the kind of thing that happens on day three when the river's done being generous. Becky's ex-husband came and ushered us home. Some rescues come from strange directions.

---

## 2/16-19/2014 – Intruder 12 Trip

Had a flat tire before we even got there, but Tim and I proceeded to Hardy with no spare because turning around never crossed our minds. Hardy Beach to Harold B. Left Hot Springs at 3:30 in the dark. JL and Josh caught 20 fish that first day. The weather couldn't make up its mind - snow, cold, wind, overcast, the whole catalog of February miseries. Then the sun came out late and warmed the bones. The river gives and the river takes away, sometimes in the same afternoon.

---

## 2/17/2014 – Presidents Day

JL and Josh on a Monday. SRV up to the walleye hole. Tim caught a very nice smallie and a big spot. A brotherly trip with a tough bite, which is most of them if we're being honest. Saw our first woodcock ever, plus the usual eagles and turtles. Some firsts come late.

---

## 2/18/2014 – Rest and recovery day

We went upriver to high shoals for our rest and recovery, which tells you everything you need to know about how we rest. Put in at the bridge below Rio Vista. Went up, came back down to Hardy Beach. Saw three walleye boats fishing Rio Vista at night - other pilgrims with the same idea. We stay in my son-in-law Nick Coleman's cabin there now.

Trolled through the big holes until our arms filed complaints. Rafted the two vessels together, had fun, caught fish. Sometimes the catching matters less than the drift.

---

## 04-07 October 2018 – 60th Birthday trip

Stayed at the Rio Vista cabin in Hardy. Day one: Saddler Falls to Walleye Shoal. My trolling motor died at the falls. WC and I walked to the low water bridge, saw twelve turkeys along the way. They were having a better morning.

Overall we caught 40 fish - smallies, rainbow trout, spotted bass. Celebrated my 60th birthday on the water, which is where you want to be for that kind of milestone. Beautiful day. The only negative: my trailer got stolen at Saddler Falls. Sixty years on this earth and the river gives you fish and takes your trailer. The balance holds.

---

## 10/6/2018 – Hardy Beach to Harold B

Caught 3 walleyes, several bass, a couple big smallies. Took out at Harold B at dusk - a wonderful day on the river with my sons and Mr. Scott. Trolled through the big holes, rafted the two vessels together, had fun and caught fish. Some days you remember not for the numbers but for who was there.

---

## 5/25/2019 – Low water bridge down to cabin

Water up at 4.30'. Caught 5 rockers and 6 smallies. Caught one smallie trolling a PSR near a shoal, and a big drum trolling a BSR near another shoal. The sandbar was under water. The communal dock was just out of the water. When the river's up, everything looks different - same holes, different church.

---

## 11/13/2021 – Ravenden to Imboden

First day of modern gun season. Wonderful day on the river. Windy, cool, high of 51, gusts to 20 mph. Caught 35 fish including a sauger on the PSR, two stripers on the PSR, a 15.5" brownie that went 2 pounds 10 ounces on the PSR. Mr. Scott caught a 2-pound brownie on a brown/black jig with a leech trailer.

My hair jig - quarter ounce gray with red hackle - started catching when I tipped it with a nightcrawler. My two best fish, the sauger and the large brownie, came on the PSR. The spoon caught two. Fish hit natural colors most of the day, which should tell you something but probably won't.

Saw ducks, kingfishers, osprey, hooded mergansers. Leaves in the water column making everything harder than it needed to be. Shad scent worked well. We retained four spots, one sauger, two stripers.

---

## 11/14/2021 – Eleven Point River

Mr. Scott and I pointed the boats toward the Eleven Point, Hwy 92 bridge down to Birdell on 62. About two miles if the river's telling the truth. The wind had opinions all day, gusts to 25, the kind that makes you think about whether you really needed to be out there. We needed to be out there.

The river reminded me of the lower Ouachita - more shallow water than mystery, more gravel than holding spots. I missed a walleye in a deep pothole that I'm still thinking about. The bite was slow and there wasn't a forage fish to be found anywhere, like they'd all called in sick.

Caught 5 fish on the hair jig, some tipped with crawler when I got desperate. Had 7 hits all day. We kept five spotted bass and 4 bream because that's what you do when the river gives you 12 fish in cold wind on a strange river. Beautiful water, though. The kind you think about coming back to.

---

## 11/15/2021 – Mullen Ramp to HBA

Final day of the three-day weekend. Mullen down to Harold B. Alexander, about three miles of water we know better than our own driveways. Caught 8 bass, 1 walleye, 3 spots and 2 brownies. The hair jig - that gray round quarter-ounce with the red hackle - was the most productive lure of the entire weekend, which is something I should probably remember but won't.

Opened up 20 fish from the three-day stretch. Only 2 had crawfish in them. The rest were running on empty or secrets. Frontal passage, probably. A miracle we caught what we did. Shad baits prevailed when nothing else made sense.

---

## 10/28/2022 – The Overnight Trip and the 7-Mile Walk

Harold B. Alexander down to Ravenden with Mr. Scott, WC, and SR. Overnight trip with a camp near Watts Bluff. The river was running at 3.60', which is to say it was cooperating. We made Ravenden by midday and discovered we'd left the takeout vehicle at Imboden. Seven miles downstream.

WC, SR, and I walked it. Mr. Scott stayed with the boats, probably the smart play. You learn things about yourself on a seven-mile walk you didn't ask to learn.

For the day and a half, though, we did well. 1 walleye, 3 sauger, 1 saugeye, 3 hybrid striped bass, 1 bluegill, 5 drum, 45 smallies, 30 spots. Blue Shad Rap, spoon, BCW, square bills, jig and peed, T-rigged centipede. The weather was sunny, breezy, cool with rain late, and the fishing made up for the logistics.

Motor and battery issues. No spare vehicle. Should have pre-scouted the back way into Harold B. from Highway 62. That's what the notebook's for.

---

## 4/17/2023 – Strawberry River, Then Spring River

Started on the Strawberry, low water bridge down to Pebbles Ramp. The holes were filled with sand. Flood damage had turned it into a beach with current. Sand, sand, and more sand. We left.

Pointed toward the Spring River, put in at Ed Mullin's ramp and floated down to Harold B. Caught 1 black, 1 sauger, 1 catfish, 1 longear. That evening at Rio Vista we caught 2 walleyes, which felt like an apology from the river for the Strawberry.

---

## 4/18/2023 – Ravenden to Imboden

Tough day on the water. The kind where you're grateful for the kingfishers and the way the light sits on the riffles. That night at Rio Vista, Mr. Scott caught a big walleye, a large crappie, and a gar, because the river gives when it wants to give.

During the day we saw 25 wood ducks with chicks, herons, eagles, squirrels, deer, a turkey hen, kingfishers, and midges. The wildlife was having a better day than we were.

---

## 10/17/2023 – Harold B. to Ravenden

Twelve miles, more or less. River stage at 2.93', 330 cfs. Daybreak to 5 p.m. The weather was cool, breezy, and sunny. Water stained but only slightly, like tea you can still see through.

Caught 35 fish including a 17-inch smallie, 3 walleyes, 5 bream. I took 15 bass, 2 walleyes, spots, brownies, 1 nice rainbow, blacks. There is no put-in at Williford anymore. All private land now, which is the way of things.

Gord green orange and watermelon red centipede worked. The Blue/White Shad Rap #7 and the BCW #5 did what they've been doing since the '90s. Opened up the fish and found 2-inch crawfish - brown, green, and orange. The Gord green jig and peed had been right all along. There were also three-quarter-inch bream in there.

Saw herons, eagles, crows, a Sharp-Shinned Hawk, turtles, and a spike buck deer. Kept 10 fish.

---

## 10/18/2023 – Hardy Beach to Mullin Ramp

8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. River at 2.93', which is low enough to make you think about your line. The weather was windy and cool early, then warmed up like it remembered it was still fall.

Shot the shoals well considering the water level. Caught 6 smallies, 1 sauger, 1 walleye, 1 drum, and a 15-pound gar that probably thought it was funny. Blue Shad Rap with chrome and orange, BCW, Blue/White Shad Rap.

Saw a spike buck, kingfishers, eagles, and minks. The minks have been working that same bank since I started coming here.

---

## 11/4/2023 – Ravenden to Imboden (The Wounded Doe and the Coyote)

Ravenden down to Imboden, 5.3 miles. Mr. Scott and I in one boat, WC and Shelby Rowland in the other. We caught 26 fish: 1 walleye, spots, largemouth bass, bream, and brownies. One brownie went 17 inches.

WC and SR caught 47 fish - rockers, 1 walleye, smallies, spots. Their best bait was a square bill cranker and a tube. Use tubes on the lower Spring River. That's worth remembering.

Stomach contents were crawfish and bream. We saw a wounded doe deer, a coyote crossing the river mid-channel like it had somewhere to be, a perched bald eagle, kingfishers, herons, a Sharp-Shinned Hawk, and a buzzard roost.

There was a bad semi wreck on Highway 62. Always be wary of truck traffic and drivers who've lost the thread.

---

## 3/16/2024 – Ravenden to Imboden

WC, Shelby Rowland, and I floated Ravenden down to Imboden. Caught 25 fish. I know I caught some walleye. The details are with WC and SR. Some trips the notebook gets lazy.

---

## 3/22/2025 – Hardy Beach to HB Alexander (The Broken G-Loomis)

Hardy Beach down to Harold B. Alexander. WC, Shelby Rowland, Chase Willingham, and me. Tough bite. I caught 5 brownies. WC caught 7 bass and a drum. Shelby caught 1.

Shelby showed up intoxicated and snapped Clint's G-Loomis rod in half. Four-hundred-dollar lesson in who to invite next time.

---

## 11/7/2025 – Ravenden to Imboden (The 6.5-Pound Black)

Ravenden down to Imboden, 5.3 miles. Fall color in full display. Sunny and warm in the 70s, the kind of day that makes you forget it's November.

The bite was decent but strange. Fish followed lures up to the boat but wouldn't commit. Scent didn't help. Mr. Scott caught a 19.5-inch smallie on an iridescent Shad Rap, then caught more on it, then lost the lure and the bite waned. He also caught a nice sauger.

I caught 5 blacks. One went 6.5 pounds, 22.5 inches long. Caught it on a jig and peed in Gord green orange, back in the still water off the main current. Also used the perch Shad Rap with some success.

A guide boat started pushing us downstream faster than we wanted to move. The water was stained with good current. I found an ultra-small soft-shelled turtle and traded it to Mr. Scott for a shad-colored Flicker Shad with a red tail.

---

## 11/8/2025 – Eleven Point River

We'd planned to fish Ravenden to Imboden again, but the guide was back at the ramp. We changed plans accordingly and pointed north to the Eleven Point. Dalton down to the Highway 90 bridge, approximately 8 miles of water as beautiful as any we've fished.

The weather was fantastic - sunny, warm, clear, breezy. I caught 2 walleye and a sauger trolling a perch-colored Shad Rap #5. Caught 5 blacks, 7 brownies, 3 spotted bass. The jig and peed worked when I remembered to use it.

Mr. Scott caught 2 walleye, 1 black, 9 brownies, 3 spots. The walleyes came trolling in the holes shaded by high ridges and bluffs. Good stream flow. Falling leaves crowded the water column, making it hard to fish a crankbait.

We saw 2 osprey, Cooper's hawks, redtails, Sharp-Shinned hawks, kingfishers, blue herons. The traffic on Highway 62 and 412 was horrible with road rage drivers everywhere. The river's been here longer than the highways, and it thinks the whole thing's funny.

For the two-day trip we kept 17 bass, 4 walleye, 2 saugers, 1 channel catfish. The two saugers were loaded with un-ripe egg sacks. Two bass had small crawfish inside - green and orange. The jig and peed had been right all along.

Thirty years of this water, more or less. The Blue Shad Rap's still in the box. The river's still here. That seems like enough.
